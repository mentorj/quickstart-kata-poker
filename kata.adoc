= Poker hand kata


Basic data structure handling, refactoring, functions composing

== Step 1: check hand for pair

== Step 2  : Check hand for 3 of a kind

== Step 3 : check hand for 4 of a kind

== Step 4 : Check for 2 pairs


== Step 5 : Check for full house

New difficult point here, ACE  value!! Refactoring, new data structure handling, HoF

== Step 6 : Check for straight flush

== Step 7 : Check for straights

==  Step 8 : Check for royal flush

== Step 9 : Evaluating hands
We need to get a score (number) for a given hand:
+  introduce a new enum with possible hand evaluation (from CARD_VALUE if no combo found  to ROYAL FLUSH)
+ change the boolean type to a Tuple containing the combo rating, rank for this combo 
+ use pattern matching to return the score

That 's all folks
